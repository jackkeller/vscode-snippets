# Visual Studio Code User Snippets

> A few helpful (hopefully) snippets to be used in VS Code.

Where you'll find them, and where you'll save new ones!

First off, you can open the Command Palette and type **Configure User Snippets**. 

Then select an existing User Snippet, or you can create a new global snippets file. Global only means that any project will have access to said snippets, and the file(s) can be found at:

**Mac**: `$HOME/Library/Application Support/Code/User/snippets/(language).json`  
**Linux**: `$HOME/.config/Code/User/snippets/(language).json`  
**Windows**: `%APPDATA%\Code\User\snippets\(language).json`

## So why should I care?

I mean, you don't *have* to care about saving time, and reducing errors in mundane programming tasks. That's on you.

But if you **DO** care, then have a bit of fun peeking into the snippets folder, use, modify to suit your needs, or create your own!

Also, there is a pretty handy tool to help you out with escaping the code and newlines in a sane way if you visit [snippet generator](https://snippet-generator.app/) and you can generate snippets for VSCode, Sublime Text, and Atom!

Cheers, if you have some fun snippets you'd like to see added submit a PR and I'll take a look!
